## Streaming service comparison tool

This tool allows the user to build a list of movies they want to see and then compare streaming and video rental services based on their list.

The tool is powered by the [CanIStream.It](http://canistream.it) API.

The tool runs entirely within the browser, so all data is lost when the page reloads. So far, only the basic UI has been built. There are no calls to [CanIStream.It](http://canistream.it). All data is simply placeholder data (generated by a random number generator) and the visual design is very crude.
